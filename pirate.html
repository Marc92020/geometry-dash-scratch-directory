  <h1 id="title"><center>how to get free geometry dash</center></h1>
  <center><p>i dont condone piracy (please dont smite me github) but if you want free geometry dash heres a guide to get it virus free anyway (ill probably delete this so i dont get eaten by github)</p></center>
  <br>
  <h1><center>this only works on windows, go find another place to get free gd i dont use mac or linux</center></h1>
  <h1 id="title"><center>step 1: GET IT FROM THE RIGHT PLACE</center></h1>
  <center><p>im not hosting it myself because i dont want to get this thing shut down. but i will provide the link to a website that i trust</p></center>
  <a href="https://steamunlocked.net/42-geometry-dash-free-game-download/"><center>download link</center></a>
  <br>
  <center><p>USE THAT LINK, YOU MIGHT GET VIRUSES IF YOU DONT</p></center>
  <br>
  <h1 id="title"><center>step 2: the download</center></h1>
  <center><p>by going to the download link, you might encounter some malicious ad, but you probably have a functioning brain so you know not to fall for it. wait for the upload haven download wait time to finish, click on download there, CLOSE THE TAB THTA SHOWS UP, then click the download button again on the website streamunlocked took you to (which should be UploadHaven) and then you get free geometry dash hooray</p></center>
  <br>
  <h1 id="title"><center>step 3: extract it</center></h1>
  <center><p>when its done you have to extract it. if you somehow dont know how, right click the file in file explorer (if you dont use file explorer then idk figure out how to extract files) then press extract then wait.</p></center>
  <br>
  <h1 id="title"><center>step 4: download shit if you have to</center></h1>
  <center><p>if your thing doesnt work you have to run all the files in the "_Redist" folder for it to work</p></center>
  <br>
  <p>there you now have free gd enjoy</p>
  <br>
<center><p>or, you could just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/">buy the real geometry dash on steam</a> if you are willing to spend like 4 dollars (omg so expensive)</p></center>
